San Francisco, often dubbed as the tech capital of the world, has always struggled with a visibly escalating concern within its city boundaries - homelessness. In 2022, the San Francisco government reported that 2,691 people suffered from chronic homelessness and that over 20,000 would have experienced homelessness at some point during the year. The goal of this report is to present a spatial analysis of the homeless concerns in the city, as documented by reports made to the 311, San Francisco's non-emergency hot-line for local government services. Using publicly available 311 data hosted on DataSF, an open data portal by the city \& county of San Francisco, I aim to investigate homeless concerns on a neighbourhood or region level. Starting with data pre-processing, I employ several methods in order to come to a conclusion, namely a Hierarchical Bayes Spatial GLM, additionally I also apply Bayesian Lasso as proposed by Casella et al. in the paper "The Bayesian LASSO" to interpret variable importance. Lastly, I conduct a small case study in the 'South of Market' neighbourhood in an attempt to explain the distribution of homeless concern cases.
